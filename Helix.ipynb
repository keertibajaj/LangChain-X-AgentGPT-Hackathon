            "Snow is a unique type of precipitatio n that has several distinct characteristics. First, snow is \n",
            "typically white in color due to its high reflectivity, which allows it to reflect much of the sunlight \n",
            "that falls on it. This is why snow can be so bright and dazzling on sunny days. Additionally,  snow \n",
            "is made up of individual snowflakes, each of which has a unique shape and size. Snowflakes can \n",
            "range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter, and their shapes can be \n",
